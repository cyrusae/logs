## Done

### FOSS: AO3.js
- [x] Fixed issue with the large blob commit (see 02.08) so "improved README" and "added user info retrieval" are two separate pull requests
- [x] Working explanation for what goes in `/utils` vs `index.ts`:
> Files in `utils` are defining the individual tools for doing something; the `index` is the global toolbox that tells someone using the scraper where to find those tools. 
>
> So I put a hammer (the ability to use `user.ts`) in the toolbox (wrote code in `index.ts` to export a callable function that runs `user.ts`), and now people can reach in and get the hammer (import `getUser` for their own purposes); but I had to invent the concept of hammers (write `user.ts` in the first place) first.
> 
> What made it memorable for me is that all the tests use `index.ts` to find what they're testing, too - `user.test.ts` imports `getUser` from `index.ts` as opposed to importing from `user.ts` directly, even though that's the location of the code it's testing: the hammer lives in the toolbox, so that's where we get it from when we want to use it on a nail, no matter what.
- [x] Added heading and user icon to the things user.ts can retrieve, with tests 
- [x] Added ability to check the works/series/etc. stats in the profile navigation menu via user.ts, with tests
- [x] Added new util `restrict.ts` to check for restricted (logged-in-only) works 
- [x] Added restricted and unrestricted test examples in `restrict.test.ts`
- [x] May or may not have overcorrected with regards to trying to keep pull requests self-contained, but at least if I overcorrected it's a different mistake this time 

### ao3-shoosh
- [x] Started work on server-side functions
- [x] Had many adventures with server-side functions
- [x] Restructured app design to use props in a more sensible way
