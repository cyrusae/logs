# feb 11 2022 

It sure is `everything happens so much` season right now, as I get to experience the mortifying ordeal of realizing I need to change up my keyboard via sheer density of beep-boop-inducing typing. Finally: a downside.

## Done

### FOSS: AO3.js

- [x] Changed hardcoded values in the functions that have to trim content off what they retrieve to constants that explain themselves

### FOSS: BobaBoard

- [x] Started new BobaEditor README rewrite
- [x] Revamped BobaEditor "getting started" page
- [x] Fixed issue with "recommended tools" page 

## To do 

- [ ] Figure out how to handle restrict.ts in AO3.js
- [ ] Finish 2022 updates for BobaEditor README
- [ ] Implement style in BobaEditor README on other bobarepos
- [ ] Add new content to "getting started" documentation for BobaEditor
- [ ] Edit other "getting started" documentation to match
- [ ] Log questions to address in editor documentation rewrites
- [ ] List of dependent documentation needed
- [ ] Figure out where to store README copypasta as a resource?
- [ ] Comprehensive vetting of current state of BobaDocs for triage/priority decisions

Back to personal:
- [ ] Restructure oceanside priorities (gradience nice to have, but not a dealbreaker)
- [ ] oceanside foreground image handling
- [ ] oceanside background image handling
- [ ] oceanside ambient sound handling
- [ ] Start building up oceanside resource files
- [ ] Verify markdown loading works sans gradience
