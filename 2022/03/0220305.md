Computer may be back down to the normal amount of haunted after a run of having to reinstall Start Menu every time we restarted, stay tuned

## Notes

Here are some things that a better version of oceanside wants:

- Rewrite into SCSS so I can use mixins; currently writing raw CSS to avoid conflicts with my various agonies. This is probably pretty up there as far as things it's not unrealistic to accomplish before the end of finals, at least.
- 

## Done

- [x] Fixed oceanside background image issue
- [x] Basic boxy layout, footer, routing for oceanside
- [x] Started distributing scenes 
- [x] There are more assets
