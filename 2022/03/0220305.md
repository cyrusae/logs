Computer may be back down to the normal amount of haunted after a run of having to reinstall Start Menu every time we restarted, stay tuned

## Notes

Here are some things that a better version of oceanside wants:

- Rewrite into SCSS so I can use mixins; currently writing raw CSS to avoid conflicts with my various agonies. This is probably pretty up there as far as things it's not unrealistic to accomplish before the end of finals, at least.
- Systematize descriptions more (will happen by the end of this draft to some extent, also)

## Done

- [x] Fixed oceanside background image issue
- [x] Basic boxy layout, footer, routing for oceanside
- [x] Started distributing scenes 
- [x] There are more assets 
- [x] Quotes for oceanside (background, text color change, text shadow, credits box, superimposition) work!

## To do

- [ ] CSS animations for the quotes
- [ ] CSS animations for the hero images
- [ ] Background images and background image handling
- [ ] Get Odile photos off of my phone
- [ ] Get red sun photos off of my phone
- [ ] Sound fade-in handling
- [ ] Finish this draft so I have the actual corpus to be marking up like this
- [ ] Parallaxing for the background image
