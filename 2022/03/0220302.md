SO THAT MOVE **SUCKED** AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD MY DESKTOP SET BACK UP SINCE MY [LAST ENTRY](/2022/02/0220211.md)

*YEAH*

## Notes

Focus shifting towards `oceanside` for a minute because it's my final and we've a quarter system so it is, in fact, finals.

## Done

- [x] Be alive (This is partly a joke but the amount of real-world work it took to get back here is somewhat enraging. So. Only partly.)
- [x] Refamiliarize myself with my own got damb to-do list
- [x] Honestly other than that it's mostly been physical office setup, I had grand ambitions but in practice I am just a little bastard and require human sleep
