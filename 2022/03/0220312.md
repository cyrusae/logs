I've been picking away at edits at the end of the day but didn't log the last couple because it's mostly been "background image placeholders replaced with not placeholders" level. Regardless:

## Done:
- [x] New specific animation for the oceanside kicker image
- [x] Added first Chihuly garden hero images
- [x] Placeholder image update/removal continues
- [x] Still working on the parallaxing question
- [x] Investigated using eventListeners because laziness doesn't seem viable 
- [x] Made oceanside kicker image punchier 
- [x] Responsive layout works on narrow screens again

## To do:
- [ ] Detection of which components are within visual viewport
- [ ] Content animation/"generation" based on presence in viewport
- [ ] Implement scrolling smoke backgrounds 
- [ ] Add background music (stretch goal)
- [ ] The state of "need a draft to test this with" intensifies
- [ ] ARIA descriptions of final choices of image 
- [ ] Make sure PNGtree credits match the assets I end up going with
- [ ] Organize `/public` better now that image troubleshooting is dealt with 
- [ ] Allow users to turn the sound/animation/parallax effects off. Simplest answer given how densely integrated there are might be a no-funny-business completely different page (no eventlisteners and none of the CSS effects added)? But that means no toggling and is also all-or-nothing.

## Some things I saw today that are neat:
- [This CSS transformation tester/simulator](https://css-transform.moro.es/)
- ["A tale of two viewports"](https://www.quirksmode.org/mobile/viewports.html)
- [Color affects subjective time perception](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29374198/)
- [Vanilla JS helper for detecting whether something is in the viewport](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-test-if-an-element-is-in-the-viewport-with-vanilla-javascript/)

### Current attempt at giving myself a carrot to procrastinate with:
[Mystery Flesh Pit National Park](https://www.mysteryfleshpitnationalpark.com/post/190237475203/wildlife-safety-brochure-though-the-mystery), which I haven't been able to read much of yet (sure is finals! Jesus Christ!) but comes highly recommended. Very normal animals throughout!

### Most memorable typo made while Googling something
`fjavascripot`

You know, JavaScript for fjords. That are also cookware. (My hands do... things. There are things, which my hands do.)
