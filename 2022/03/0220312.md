I've been picking away at edits at the end of the day but didn't log the last couple because it's mostly been "background image placeholders replaced with not placeholders" level. Regardless:

## Done:
- [x] New specific animation for the oceanside kicker image
- [x] Added first Chihuly garden hero images
- [x] Placeholder image update/removal continues
- [x] Still working on the parallaxing question
- [x] Investigated using eventListeners because laziness doesn't seem viable 
- [x] Made oceanside kicker image punchier 
- [x] Responsive layout works on narrow screens again

## To do:
- [ ] Detection of which components are within visual viewport
- [ ] Content animation/"generation" based on presence in viewport
- [ ] Implement scrolling smoke backgrounds 
- [ ] Add background music (stretch goal)
- [ ] The state of "need a draft to test this with" intensifies
- [ ] ARIA descriptions of final choices of image 
- [ ] Make sure PNGtree credits match the assets I end up going with
- [ ] Organize `/public` better now that image troubleshooting is dealt with 
- [ ] Allow users to turn the sound/animation/parallax effects off. Simplest answer given how densely integrated there are might be a no-funny-business completely different page (no eventlisteners and none of the CSS effects added)? But that means no toggling and is also all-or-nothing.
