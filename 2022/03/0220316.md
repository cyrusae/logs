## Goals:
- [x] Get images from the same source/context to randomize amongst themselves on load
- [x] Handle translucent backgrounds at a level lower than `#beach`
- [ ] Meaningful final draft progress instead of getting more excited about the technical side, oh my G-d
- [ ] Parallax handling for the parallax havers
- [x] Image description content advancements
- [ ] Animations trigger on sight instead of on load

## Done:
- [x] Successful image randomization ([unlike yesterday](0220315.md))
- [x] Set up divs for captions on hero images
- [x] Clean up readability and redundancy on the CSS stylesheet
- [x] Wrapped titles with `<cite>` tags
- [x] All poems/etc. are now `aside`s
- [x] `alt=''` added to decorative/background images in main document 
- [x] Added background image for quote from *Summer in Winter in Summer*
- [x] Added quotes from *Summer in Winter in Summer* and *Let Them Not Say* to `index.tsx`
- [x] Improved formatting for poems that are new to being displayed
- [x] Culling unused imports for `index.tsx`
- [x] Test handling caption visibility with onFocus but duplicating the content as `aria-describedby` too 
- [x] Test handling caption visibility with plain CSS
- [x] HOVER CAPTIONS WORK AS INTENDED (with buttons, for mouse and keyboard users)
- [x] Moved *Let Them Not Say* to `credit.tsx` as bonus kicker
- [x] Credits page aesthetics improved (a lot)
- [x] Downloaded most remaining desired backgrounds

## To do:
- [ ] Why isn't kicker image maintaining original aspect ratio.
- [ ] Parallaxes!!!
- [ ] Finish and integrate final draft
- [ ] Smoke backgrounds and scrolling thereof
- [ ] Image description content for all images 
- [ ] Reorganize `/public` to be less chaos gremlin-y
- [ ] Tweak spacing of `.credit` on some poems
- [ ] Finalize credits page *(after final run of third-party content is confirmed)*
- [ ] Wrap sets of scenes as `<article>`s *(after final order of scenes determined)*
- [ ] Writeup explaining a11y choices made above/throughout *(in final README update)*
- [ ] Better-looking credits *(not mandatory but nice to have)*
- [ ] Make hover captions fade in and out instead of being in-your-face *(after v 1.0.0)*
