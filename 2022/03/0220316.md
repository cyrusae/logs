## Goals:
- [x] Get images from the same source/context to randomize amongst themselves on load
- [x] Handle translucent backgrounds at a level lower than `#beach`
- [ ] Add all remaining needed images (pending PNGtree backgrounds)

- [ ] Image description content 

## Done:

- [x] Added background image for quote from *Summer in Winter in Summer*
- [x] Added quotes from *Summer in Winter in Summer* and *Let Them Not Say* to `index.tsx`
- [x] Improved formatting for poems that are new to being displayed
