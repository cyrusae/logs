## Done:

- [x] Attempted to randomize between Chihuly images using props (also didn't work)
- [x] Attempted to randomize between Chihuly images using state (*also* didn't work, but [solved the next day](0220316.md)

## To do:
- [ ] Handle prefers-reduced-motion in regards to my animations

- [ ] Wrap quote sections as `<aside>`s
- [ ] Add `role='img'` to top level of said `aside`s
- [ ] Separate unit lists of contiguous scenes with `<article>`
- [ ] Make `#beach` be `<main>`
- [ ] Wrap titles of poems/talks in `<cite>`
- [ ] Animations trigger on scroll in 
- [ ] Add exit animations to trigger on scroll out once that's working
- [ ] See if adding `intrinsicsize` settings ameliorates flickery loading issue on mobile Safari
- [ ] Make credits page prettier and link to FC server on it
- [ ] Mark quotes as being `aria-labelledby` their respective credits
- [ ] Parallax animation for tapestry background
- [ ] Slow scroll (also parallax) for kicker image
- [ ] Give hero images clickable captions
- [ ] Use hero image captions as their `aria-describedby` content
- [ ] *(stretch goal if I'm having a good day on Friday, otherwise outside scope for v1.0.0)* Add background sound handling for rain effects
