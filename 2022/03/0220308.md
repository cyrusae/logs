whooooo's got two thumbs and just got done with a round trip train to Portland

I have now been on a train, in my life. Two of them even.

Anyway!

## Done
- [x] Backwards-engineered deploying a Remix site to Netlify after creation
- [x] In related news, **[Oceanside is on Netlify now](https://oceanside-essay.netlify.app)**
- [x] Started implementing per-section backgrounds
- [x] Discovered new and fascinating issues with the backgrounds

I also have the rest of the images together but they're not live yet.

## To do 
- [ ] Finish implementing CSS animations
- [ ] Background troubleshooting
- [ ] Add the rest of the images
- [ ] Get metadata/credits up to date
- [ ] ...Give myself more of a draft to work with, here
