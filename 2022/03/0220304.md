can we get back to coding please

## Priorities (in order)

1. Shippable version of oceanside for class
2. Bobadocs spring renovation hits a stopping point that is cool and fun to before I leave for surgery
3. AO3.js upgrades
4. Gradience that gradiences more

## Today's adventures use:

- [Performant Parallaxing library](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing)
- [Animista CSS animations](https://animista.net/play/entrances/slide-in/slide-in-bottom)

## Done

- [x] Organization for oceanside resources
- [x] Bizarrely esoteric oceanside troubleshooting
- [x] I think this is the first time I've crashed VSC, which is surprising lag for me
