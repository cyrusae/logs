## Done

- Started doing this so I have somewhere to put updates other than Discord or writing them out in README-appropriate coherency 
- Some project progress:

### deckdater

- Can add [Fuse](https://fusejs.io/) to enable fuzzy searching from user input 
- Decided to keep separate table of card names in order to import as json object for Fuse to search against
- Decided to strip punctuation of user-entered text in order to avoid issues with e.g. smart quotes or commas 
- Work on carpentry (building/updating cards list) procedures including redundancy in case of errors (exclusive full join between old data and new)

Process changes/results:

- User input becomes one string of results based on fuzzy search against names of cards
- Can add ability to keep the non-card name results for later and check Scryfall... later
- Search results table built as temporary table result of inner join on card names in deck against full list of cards 

### dicemaker

- Asked stats prof for help with the binomial distribution approximation
- Recommended: R

### gradience

- [Have resource for detecting background color in step 4](https://github.com/essential-randomness/bobadocs/blob/06494b0dc9db49347ccf322f092411c4c4b4ca3c/src/components/github/FilteredLabelsList.module.css)

### FOSS: Ao3.js

- Started trying to determine how to let [Ao3.js](https://github.com/essential-randomness/AO3.js) take information from user profiles
- (Did not succeed yet)

### NEW: ao3-shhh

- 

## To do 

- [ ] Update deckdater README with revisions to search method 
- [ ] Update deckdater READMORE with revisions to README
- [ ] Update deckdater SQL with changes to carpentry procedures 
- [ ] Determine whether search method revision handles sanitization (I think it should? Prevents any user input from ever going direct to SQL)
- [ ] Handle deckdater APIs
- [ ] Test carpentry 

- [ ] Meet with instructor about dicemaker
- [ ] Work on dicemaker frontend 
- [ ] Determine how to get R to talk to JS

- [ ] Update gradience/spanner documentation with resource link
- [ ] Make lads use props in more appropriate ways 
- [ ] Separately implement markdown compilation for oceanside and then add spanner

- [ ] README/explanations for ao3-shhh
- [ ] Trial frontend for ao3-shhh
- [ ] Reminder text regarding user/pseud distinction for ao3-shhh
- [ ] Reminder text regarding limitations for ao3-shhh
- [ ] Working prototype allowing hiding works as proof of concept 

- [ ] Try Ao3.js dilemma again but get help this time
