## Done

### FOSS: AO3.js

- Added ability to retrieve optional profile fields (birthday, location, email address)
- Fixed user ID retrieval breaking on profiles with a location filled out 
- Added a test for users with the optional data 
- Selectors somewhat more sophisticated 

Caveat:

- Accidentally blobbed all of these fixes together because creating new branches on my own fork felt irrationally wasteful
- Learned that I should not indulge that feeling
